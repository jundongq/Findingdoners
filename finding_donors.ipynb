    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "There are three supervised learning models that are appropriate:\n",
    "\n",
    "------------\n",
    "(1) Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB).\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes methods are a group of supervised learning models that are applying Bayes's theorem. The underlying assumptions of all Naive Bayes methods is that all the features (attributes) that determine the outcome (a label) are conditionally independent given the label. Naive Bayes methods are widely used on building spam filters [1,2]. Using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, the prediction of a label given the features of training examples can be reduced to the esimation of the probabilities of labels, and the probabilites of features given labels. According to the assumption of the probabilites of features given labels, there are variations of Naive Bayes classifiers: Gaussian Naive Bayes, multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "--The strengths of GaussianNB model are as follows:\n",
    "  * Inference is cheap, so Naive Bayes classifier can be very fast. \n",
    "  * Parameters are few. Only the prior probability distribution of labels, and probability of features given labeles matter.\n",
    "  * Naive Bayes decouple the class conditional distribution. The decoupling makes each joint distribution to be estimated independently as a sets of one-dimension distribution for each feature, which is helpful for supervised learning in terms of reducing its sensitivity to the curse of dimensionality [3].\n",
    "  \n",
    "--The weakness of GaussianNB model are:\n",
    "  * The interrelationship between features cannot be modeled.\n",
    "  * The calculated probability is not convincing, due to the simple assumptions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Given the data, the task here is to classify whether a person is making above 5OK or not. It is a simple binary output. The application of Naive Bayes on spam filtering is similar to this case. Therefore, Naive Bayes makes a good candidate for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "(2) Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression is a commonly used binary classifier [4, 5]. This algorithm takes adavantage of the logistic (aka sigmoid) function with characteristics of having output in range of [0, 1], so that its output can be interpreted as probability. An aribitrary threshold can be set by users. Instances that produce probability above the threshold can be considered as positive, otherwise, negative.   \n",
    "\n",
    "--The strengths of logistic regression:\n",
    " * It produces probability for each category, so that is easy to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "--The weakness of logistic regression:\n",
    " * Dummy variable required for categorical data, which can increase the dimensionality.\n",
    " * It requires through feature selection to obtain good performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Logitistic regression is very easy to implement due to its simplicity. The logistic regression models the log odds of binomial events. Given the goal of this project as building a binary classifier, logistic regression natually makes a good candidate.\n",
    " \n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "(3) AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) is a meta-estimator, which is an ensemble of a series of classifiers. Researchers use is for face detection [6] or cancer detection [7].\n",
    "\n",
    "--The strenghs of AdaBoost:\n",
    " * It takes adavantage of weak learners\n",
    " * It is usually more accurate than individual weak learners\n",
    " * It can deal with mixtures of numeric and categorical features\n",
    "\n",
    "--The weakness of AdaBoost:\n",
    " * It requires long training time\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost can take adavantage of any classifier, and build an additive model with it. The boosted model usually performance better. So, AdaBoost could be a good candidate for this classification problem.\n",

    "### Implementation - Creating a Training and Predicting Pipeline\n",
    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",
    "   - Record the total prediction time.\n",
    " - Calculate the accuracy score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    " - Calculate the F-score for both the training subset and testing set.\n",
    "   - Make sure that you set the `beta` parameter!"

    "AdaBoostClassifier was chosen as the final model in this project.\n",

    "Intuitively, it is a method that uses adaptive method to boost classifier's performance. This method needs a base classifier, which can be any type of legit classifier, as long as it performs better than random guessing. In this case, an decision tree, is the default base classifier. Decision tree can deal with mixture of categorical and numerical features. The base classifer can have hundreds of variants,\n",

    "\n",
    "The final classifier is the ensemble of all base classifier variants, in the form of linear combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**H** = sign($\\alpha$<sub>j</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>j</sub>**)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$<sub>j</sub> is a weight associated with a base classifier variant. Each base classifer variant is trained on weighted data points. A weight associated with a datapoint is donoted as \n",
    "\n",
    "<center>**W<sub>i</sub>**, i = 1,...,N, where N is the total number of data points in training dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**W<sub>i</sub>** is under distribution *D<sub>j</sub>*, which j indicates the iteration step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, weight for each datapoint is assigned as 1/N, then a base classifier variant, **h<sub>j</sub>**, is trained on the weighted data points, with objective of minimizing weighted error. After training, some data points from the training dataset are correctly classified, and some are misclassified, by a trained base classifier. The weighted error is computed, and then the associated weight for **h<sub>j</sub>** is computed according to the weighted error. Then, **W<sub>i</sub>** is updated to **W<sub>i+1</sub>**. After updating, the weights on misclassified data points will increase, so that the next base classifier variant can pay more attention to it for minimizing the weighted error. According to this procedure, the AdaBoost goes through all J base classifier variants, and the $\\alpha$<sub>j</sub>, j = 1, ..., J, will be returned eventually.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost training process consists of a series of base classifiers training. After training, each base classifier variant serves as an expert on certain feature space, and can classify the labels based on these features. A set of base classifiers can cover the whole feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final classifier, **H** = sign($\\alpha$<sub>j</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>j</sub>**), is the ensemble of the base classifer variants. For example, a base classifier variant **h<sub>1</sub>** might be making better classifying decisions than random guessing according to one feature, say 'age' in this case, one other base classifer variant **h<sub>2</sub>** can do better job on classifying than random guessing based on 'capital-gain', and viriant **h<sub>3</sub>**, and **h<sub>4</sub>** classify targets based on 'sex' or 'education', and so on. The AdaBoostClassifier takes adavantage of each classifier vatiant's strengths and creates an ensemble classifier in form of \"$\\alpha$<sub>1</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>1</sub>** + $\\alpha$<sub>2</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>2</sub>** + $\\alpha$<sub>3</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>3</sub>** + $\\alpha$<sub>4</sub>$ \\times$ **h<sub>4</sub>** + .....\". Finaly, AdaBoostClassifier can learn to make correct classification decisions according to the sign of the linear combination of all base classifier vatiants during the training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While making a prediction, each base classifier vatiant (an expert in certain feature space) takes one new data point as input and make a prediction according to its learned underlying relationship between certain feature space and labels. Each base classifier's prediction is associated with a weight.The weighted sum of all predictions from all base classifiers produces the final prediction."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
